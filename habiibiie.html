      <b>And amazing things happen when people meet; they learn, inspire one another,<br>
       come up with new ideas and sometimes they even change the world.</b> <br>
       I think it will be more effective than online sessions. I really want to get to know more about web development.<br> 
       I hope It will be really fun to do programming with others and learning from them will be also a wonderful and powerful experiences.</p></i>
